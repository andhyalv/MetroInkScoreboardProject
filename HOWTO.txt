## do this on a new pi.

1)sudo apt update
sudo apt install libqt5test5
sudo apt install qt4-qmake qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev

2) Create Virtual Environment
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv myenv

3) Activate VEnvironment
source myenv/bin/activate

4) Install Packages:
pip install opencv-python google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-api-python-client numpy

Connect to central dashboard
pip install flask
pip install flask-cors

5. Copy the folders from the flashdrive.
	(If Central Server) Make the dashboard.html available on desktop in a folder called template.
	Put the folders on their own in the Desktop.

6.Networking 
Find IP's for the Central PC and Pi IPs.
Central: BAsed on OS, usually IP Config.

Get the PI IP's for the main dashboard and edit the dashboard.py file on the Central System 
	to reflect that. 
Option 1: Keep the DHCP IP's and do not disconnect or turn off pi.
Option 2: Assign a static IPEdit the dhcpcd.conf file:

	Open the terminal on the Pi and type:

		sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

	Scroll to the end of the file and add the following lines to configure the static IP:

	For Ethernet (if you’re using a wired connection):	

	interface eth0
	static ip_address=192.168.1.100/24   # Replace with your desired static IP
	static routers=192.168.1.1           # Replace with your router's IP (usually the gateway IP)
	static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8   # You can use Google's DNS or your router's DNS

	For Wi-Fi (if you're using wireless):

	interface wlan0
	static ip_address=192.168.1.100/24   # Replace with your desired static IP
	static routers=192.168.1.1           # Replace with your router's IP (usually the gateway IP)
	static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8   # You can use Google's DNS or your router's DNS

		ip_address: The static IP address you want to assign to the Pi.

		routers: The default gateway (usually your router’s IP).

		domain_name_servers: The DNS server (use 8.8.8.8 for Google's DNS or your router’s DNS).

	Save and exit the file:

		Press Ctrl + X to close the editor.

		Press Y to confirm saving the file.

		Press Enter to confirm the filename.

	Reboot the Raspberry Pi to apply the changes:

		sudo reboot

	3. Check the Static IP Address

		After rebooting, you can check if the IP address was successfully set by typing:

		hostname -I

	This should display the static IP you configured for the Pi.
